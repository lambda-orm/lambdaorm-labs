# CLI Labs

It is a series of labs that show how to use the [lambda ORM CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lambdaorm-cli)

- [Documentation](https://github.com/lambda-orm/lambdaorm-cli/wiki)

## Simple Lab

**In this laboratory we will see:**

- How to use the Î»ORM CLI commands
- how to create a project that uses lambda ORM
- How to define a schema
- how to run a bulkInsert from a file
- how to export data from a schema
- how to import data into a schema from a previously generated export file

## Extend Model Lab

**In this laboratory we will see:**

- how to create a project that uses lambda ORM
- How to define a schema
- how to extend entities using abstract entities
- How to insert data from a file.
- how to run queries from cli to perform different types of queries

## Two stages Lab

**In this laboratory we will see:**

- how to work with two sources with different mappings
- how to define two stages and work with them
- how to use environment variables to set connections to databases
- How to insert data from a file to more than one table.
- how to use imported data from one stage to import it to another

[lab](https://github.com/lambda-orm/lambdaorm-labs/tree/main/labs/cli/03-two-stages)

## Two data sources with the same query Lab

**In this laboratory we will see:**

- How to insert data from a file to more than one table.
- how to define a stage that works with entities in different databases
- how to use environment variables to set connections to databases
- how to run a bulkInsert on entities in different databases
- how to export and import entity data in different databases

## Northwind Lab

**In this laboratory we will see:**

Creating the northwind sample database tables and loading it with sample data.
This database presents several non-standard cases such as:
	- Name of tables and fields with spaces
	- Tables with composite primary keys
	- Tables with autonumeric ids and others with ids strings

Since this is the database that was used for many examples and unit tests, you can test the example queries that are in the documentation.
We will also see some example queries to execute from CLI

## Northwind multiple datasources Lab

**In this laboratory we will see:**

- How to configure the schema to work with multiple data sources
- How to execute queries from CLI to obtain data from multiple data sources in the same query
- How to obtain the execution plan of a query and visualize which data sources the queries will be executed on

[lab](https://github.com/lambda-orm/lambdaorm-labs/tree/main/labs/cli/06-northwind-multiples-datasources)

## Northwind multiple stages Lab

**In this laboratory we will see:**

- How to configure the schema to work with multiple data sources
- How to configure the schema to work with multiple stages
- How to execute queries from CLI to obtain data from multiple data sources in the same query
- How to obtain the execution plan of a query and visualize which data sources the queries will be executed on
- How to export data from one stage and import it into another
- How can you obtain the same results regardless of whether they are stored in a single data source or in multiple data sources

## Northwind CQRS Lab

**In this laboratory we will see:**

Configure postgres databases, mysql, mongo using docker compose.
How to configure different stages:

- default: where domain entities are mapped to different data sources.
- insights: where domain entities are mapped to a single data source.
- cqrs: where domain entities are mapped to different data sources and read-only queries are executed.

How to configure a listener to synchronize data between different data sources.

We will verify that lambdaorm behaves the same whether the domain entities are mapped to a single data source or to multiple data sources.

CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) is a design pattern that separates read and write operations of a domain model.
This pattern can be difficult to implement in conventional development or with a traditional ORM, but with lambdaorm it is very simple, since we can solve it through configuration.

Consider that in this lab we are not only implementing CQRS, but we are also implementing a distributed data model, where each entity in the domain can be mapped to a different data source.
